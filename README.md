# Simple Todo Application in React

Welcome to the Todo Application in React, a simple project that demonstrates the use of class components and functional components (with hooks) to build a Todo list.

In this project, you will find two versions of the Todo Application, one using class components and one using functional components with hooks. The goal of this project is to show you the differences between the two approaches and how they can be used to build the same application.

## Class Component

Class components are the original way of building components in React. They use the class syntax to define a component and its lifecycle methods.

To create a class component, you need to create a class that extends the React.Component class and implements a render method. The render method should return a description of what the component should look like.

## Comparison

When comparing class components and functional components with hooks, there are a few key differences to consider:

- Class components use class syntax to define a component and its lifecycle methods, while functional components with hooks use functional syntax and hooks to define a component and its behavior.
- Class components have a clear lifecycle that can be used to manage side effects and perform other actions at specific times during a component's lifecycle, while functional components with hooks use hooks to manage state and perform side effects directly in the component.
- Class components are more verbose and have a longer syntax, while functional components with hooks are more concise and have a shorter syntax.

## Conclusion

Both class components and functional components with hooks can be used to build a Todo Application in React. The choice between the two approaches will depend on your personal preference and the specific requirements of your project.
